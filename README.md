# scouting-app
This was my first attempt at developing a scouting app for our local robotics team. Goals were:

  -Easily store useful data from rounds watched by "Scouters"
  -Organize data to be easily-analyzed
  -Use data to predict how well teams will do during playoffs
  -Use data to pick "alliance" teammates
  
 I understand how much this code could be improved, but keep in mind I have learned a ton from undertaking this task so be tolerant :)
